About NH Island Manager:

NH Island Manager is a tool to use with Yuzu and Ryujinx if you have multiple islands you want to work on or view. It saves the trouble of constantly copying and replacing files.

How to install:

*****IMPORTANT*****

1. For this software to work correctly the original save location for your Animal Crossing island must be clear and free of files. Please backup or copy these files to your intended island directory (see 4.) and then delete them. NH Island Manager will NOT delete these files. It must be done manually.

2. The directories that need to be cleared are %USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\yuzu\nand\user\save\0000000000000000\00000000000000000000000000000000\01006F8002326000 for Yuzu and %USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Ryujinx\bis\user\save\0000000000000001\0 for Ryujinx

3. After this is done simply unzip all the files into a directory you want then launch it (IslandLauncher.exe)

4. Specify a directory for all your saved islands in settings. Each island must be in a separate folder. 

5. Location of animal crossing game and emulator locations can be specified here.

6. After this is complete just double click on any island!

Other options:
Icon size can be changed in settings. Along with preview images if available, to use preview images you can place an image (png, bmp or jpg) in the island directory of choice named "preview" and it will automatically load on refresh.

Right clicking on an island will bring up a context menu with properties option (also on toolbar) a description for selected island can be added here. Description will be saved to island folder as "description.txt". Preview image can also be changed here by double clicking the current image.
